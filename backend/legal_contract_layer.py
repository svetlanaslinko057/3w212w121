"""
Legal Contract Signing — Phase 1 (core backend).

Scope (per product spec, Phase 1):
  1. Legal profile collected ONLY when user signs their first contract.
  2. Contract becomes an immutable snapshot at the moment of signing:
       - contract_version
       - html_snapshot
       - project_snapshot
       - legal_profile_snapshot
       - sha256_hash
       - signed_at / ip / user_agent / otp_verified
  3. Click-wrap + email OTP (reuses existing auth_otp email pipeline,
     mocked via Resend in dev — code shows up in backend.err.log).
  4. Full audit trail in `contract_signatures`.
  5. Contract-status gate:
       estimate_approved → agreement_required → legal_profile_completed
       → otp_verified_signature → agreement_signed → payment_unlocked
       → project_starts_after_payment

Phase 2 (NOT here): PDF generation (with HTML fallback), mobile+web
signing UI, Documents screen, payment gate wiring, production template.

<h1>Software Development &amp; Delivery Agreement</h1>
<p class="meta">Template version: {template_version} — {template_status}</p>
<p class="meta">Effective date: at the moment of electronic acceptance by the Client.</p>

<h2>1. Parties</h2>
<p>
  This Software Development &amp; Delivery Agreement (the
  &ldquo;<b>Agreement</b>&rdquo;) is made between:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Client</b> — <b>{client_name}</b>{client_tax_block}, having its
    billing address at <b>{client_address}</b>, contactable by phone
    <b>{client_phone}</b> and by email <b>{client_email}</b>;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Provider</b> — <b>{provider_party}</b>, operating the EVA-X /
    ATLAS DevOS product delivery system, having registered address at
    <b>{provider_address}</b>{provider_tax_block}.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Client and the Provider are each a &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and
  together the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;.
</p>

<h2>2. Project description</h2>
<p>
  The Provider will deliver the project titled
  <b>&ldquo;{project_title}&rdquo;</b>, an integrated software product
  as described in the project brief and scope snapshot bound to this
  Agreement as an immutable evidence item (Section 18).
</p>

<h2>3. Scope of work</h2>
<p>
  The scope consists of the following modules, which together form a
  single, indivisible deliverable:
</p>
{modules_html}
<p>
  Anything not explicitly named in this scope, in the bound estimate,
  or in the bound milestones list is out of scope and is governed by
  Section 8 (Change requests).
</p>

<h2>4. Deliverables</h2>
<p>
  For each module the Provider delivers (a) the working software
  artefact, (b) the source code, configuration and build manifests,
  (c) a short delivery note describing what was implemented and how to
  verify it, and (d) a passing human-validation gate (Section 7).
</p>

<h2>5. Timeline and milestones</h2>
<p>
  Estimated overall timeline: <b>{timeline}</b>. The timeline starts
  from the moment the initial payment named in Section 6 is received.
  Material timeline impact from Client-side blockers (missing inputs,
  delayed feedback, change requests) extends the timeline by the
  equivalent amount, recorded transparently in the workspace.
</p>

<h2>6. Price and payment terms</h2>
<p>Total project price: <b>{price}</b>.</p>
{payment_plan_html}
<p>
  Payments are made via the payment method selected by the Client and
  recorded as <b>{payment_method}</b>. Invoices are issued for each
  payment trigger and are payable within seven (7) days of issue
  unless an alternative cadence is stated in the payment schedule.
</p>

<h2>7. Human validation, QA and acceptance</h2>
<p>
  Each delivered module is examined by an independent human validator
  using the Provider&rsquo;s Reality / HVL validation layer
  (<b>{hvl_summary}</b>). The Client then has an acceptance window
  during which they can request fixes or sign-off in the workspace.
  If no response is recorded within the acceptance window, the module
  is treated as accepted.
</p>

<h2>8. Change requests</h2>
<p>
  Any change to scope, deliverables, timeline or price occurs by
  written change request inside the workspace. Each change request is
  priced and scheduled separately and only enters work after the
  Client&rsquo;s written approval.
</p>

<h2>9. Client obligations</h2>
<p>
  The Client agrees to (a) provide accurate brief and feedback in a
  timely manner; (b) appoint a single primary decision-maker for the
  duration of the project; (c) provide any third-party credentials,
  brand assets, and external system access reasonably necessary to
  deliver the modules in scope; and (d) make payments on the agreed
  schedule.
</p>

<h2>10. Provider obligations</h2>
<p>
  The Provider agrees to (a) deliver the modules in scope using
  qualified engineers and Provider&rsquo;s human validation layer; (b)
  surface risk, blockers and timeline impact transparently in the
  workspace; (c) keep the Client&rsquo;s materials confidential under
  Section 14; and (d) preserve immutable evidence of every signing,
  payment and acceptance event for at least the retention period in
  Section 18.
</p>

<h2>11. Developer / operator subcontracting</h2>
<p>
  The Client acknowledges that work is performed by a curated pool of
  developers and operators sourced and supervised by the Provider. The
  Provider remains contractually responsible to the Client for the
  delivery in full and for all sub-tier engagements. Names of the
  assigned developers and operators are visible to the Client inside
  the workspace.
</p>

<h2>12. Intellectual property</h2>
<p>
  Upon full payment of the price in Section 6, all project-specific
  deliverables created under this Agreement (source code, design
  assets, configuration, project documentation) transfer to the
  Client. Pre-existing components of the Provider&rsquo;s platform
  (the platform code itself, internal libraries, internal models,
  validation pipelines) remain the property of the Provider and are
  licensed to the Client on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  basis solely to operate the delivered product.
</p>

<h2>13. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>
  Each Party shall keep the other Party&rsquo;s non-public
  information confidential, use it only for the purpose of performing
  this Agreement, and protect it with at least the same degree of care
  it applies to its own confidential information. This obligation
  survives termination for three (3) years.
</p>

<h2>14. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>
  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each
  Party&rsquo;s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection
  with this Agreement is limited to the total amount actually paid by
  the Client under this Agreement during the twelve (12) months
  preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Neither Party is
  liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special or punitive
  damages, including lost profits or loss of goodwill.
</p>

<h2>15. Refund and cancellation</h2>
<p>
  Either Party may terminate this Agreement in writing. Work completed
  up to the termination date, including modules in flight, is invoiced
  at actual cost and is due on termination. Unused portions of pre-paid
  milestones are refunded within thirty (30) days. Once a module is
  accepted under Section 7, its payment is non-refundable.
</p>

<h2>16. Dispute resolution</h2>
<p>
  The Parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute in good
  faith through direct discussion. If a dispute is not resolved within
  thirty (30) days of written notice, the Parties shall attempt
  resolution by mediation. Either Party may thereafter pursue any
  remedy available at law.
</p>

<h2>17. Governing law</h2>
<p>
  This Agreement is governed by, and construed in accordance with,
  the laws of the Provider&rsquo;s jurisdiction of incorporation,
  without regard to its conflict-of-laws principles. The Parties
  submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of
  that jurisdiction for any matter not resolved under Section 16.
  <span class="placeholder">[Final jurisdiction text is set by the
  Provider&rsquo;s legal team and locked in the platform legal entity
  snapshot bound to this Agreement.]</span>
</p>

<h2>18. Electronic signature and evidence package</h2>
<p>
  This Agreement is signed electronically in accordance with applicable
  electronic-signature laws (signature level: <b>{signature_level}</b>).
  The Client confirms identity by completing the click-wrap acceptance
  flow and by entering a one-time code delivered to the registered
  email address. The Provider counter-signs at the same moment using a
  deterministic platform signing identity. The following items are
  captured at the moment of signing and stored as immutable evidence
  of mutual acceptance:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full HTML snapshot of this Agreement</li>
  <li>Snapshot of the Client&rsquo;s legal profile</li>
  <li>Snapshot of the project brief, scope, modules, milestones, price and payment plan</li>
  <li>Snapshot of the accepted estimate and selected payment method</li>
  <li>Snapshot of the Provider&rsquo;s legal entity at the moment of signing</li>
  <li>SHA-256 hash of the combined snapshot</li>
  <li>Signing timestamp, IP address, user-agent string</li>
  <li>Confirmation of the one-time code used to verify identity</li>
  <li>Template version, acceptance-copy version, signature level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I confirm my legal details are correct.</li>
  <li>I agree to the project scope, payment schedule and terms.</li>
  <li>I understand development starts after initial payment.</li>
</ul>

# Pydantic request/response models (CONTRACT-P3 — data-minimization model)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Design principles (locked):
#   • Default required set = identity + billing reachability only.
#     name + email (from session) + phone + billing address + country.
#   • tax_id is OPTIONAL by default. Required only if the user is a
#     company OR jurisdiction needs it on the invoice.
#   • passport / ID photo / personal IDs are NEVER collected by default.
#     Enhanced KYC happens later, via an external provider, only for
#     high-value contracts or flagged risk.
#   • legal_type splits the contract party shape (Section 1 of template).

    Production PDF rendering via ReportLab (pure Python, no system deps).

    Strategy:
      1. Use ReportLab Platypus — converts our contract HTML structure

      2. Header carries the project title + EVA-X branding.
      3. Footer carries page number + sha256 hint (truncated) so the printed
         PDF is self-evidencing.
      4. Bilingual-safe: all string handling is UTF-8 throughout.

    Returns base64-encoded PDF bytes. On unexpected failure logs and
    returns None — caller records `pdf_status='failed'` and keeps
    html_snapshot + sha256 as source of truth.

    The function never blocks signing (caller wraps in try/except).
